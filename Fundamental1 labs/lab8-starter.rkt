; Problem 1
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Computing education literature shows that planning before writing code leads
; to better programs. We have therefore created an experimental interface for
; you to express your program plans. We ask you to use it to plan out your
; solution to this problem, and all problems in Homework 8.

; TODO 1/3: Read the description of the planning interface on Canvas, which is
;           linked from both the Lab 8 and Homework 8 assignments.

; Now, to practice using this tool, your task is to design the function
; palindrome?, which takes a string and determines whether it is a
; palindrome (a string that has the same letters in each of forward and reverse
; order, ignoring capitalization). For clarity, here is the intended signature:

; palindrome? : String -> Boolean

; Notes:
; - You should NOT use the built-in ISL function reverse, but you are welcome to
;   define your own as a helper.
; - You are encouraged to use the built-in explode function, which takes a
;   string and produces a list of its characters (each represented as a
;   1String). The implode function then reverses this process.
; - You *must* use the ISL list abstraction(s); you MAY NOT use recursion.


; TODO 2/3: Plan your solution, using the planning interface described on the
;           canvas page for this assignment.

; TODO 3/3: Design the function palindrome? using the ISL list abstractions.
;           YOUR CODE SHOULD NOT USE ANY RECURSION.

; Recall that in Homework 6 we were trying to design a Wordle function to

; Do you remember feeling really strange writing three functions that feel SO

;           in order to abstract the three -bg functions. If you are successful,
;           you will be able to delete all three functions, all tests will still
