; Problem 1
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; In this problem you'll practice with lists by designing a function to
; help bookstores!

; Most bookstores sort the books on their shelves by the authorâ€™s last
; name. Unfortunately, some bookstore patrons do not preserve this order
; when browsing books, and simply place books back wherever they fit.

; Assume that bookstores keep all authors whose last name starts with the
; same letter on the same shelf, and those shelves are labeled with that
; letter. A record of which authors are on a given shelf would be represented
; using the following data definitions:

(define-struct shelf [letter authors])

; A Shelf is a (make-shelf 1String [List-of String])
; Interpretation: a record of the letter the authors' last name *should* start
; with, and the list of the *actual* last names on the shelf.

(define SHELF-1 (make-shelf "A" (list "Austen" "Hurston" "Angelou" "Butler" "Alvarez")))
(define SHELF-2 (make-shelf "B" (list)))
(define SHELF-3 (make-shelf "C" (list "Carle" "Coates")))
(define SHELF-4 (make-shelf "D" (list "Danny" "David" "Chris")))
(define SHELF-5 (make-shelf "E" (list)))
(define SHELF-6 (make-shelf "F" (list "Frank" "Finn")))

(define (shelf-temp s)
  (... (shelf-letter s) ...
       (list-of-string-temp (shelf-authors s)) ...))


; TODO 1/1: Design the function fix-shelves that takes a list of Shelf records
;           and produces a list of Shelf records where at least one author does
;           not belong on the Shelf. The output Shelf records should only contain
;           the authors who don't belong on that shelf. Shelf records and the authors
;           within those records should be in the same order in the output as they
;           appear in the input. Do not generate empty Shelf records; this generates
;           needlessly long reports, which annoys the employees. You have been
;           supplied a test for clarity (which you can use in your design, but
;           should supplement). Make sure your solution follows the (list) templates!
