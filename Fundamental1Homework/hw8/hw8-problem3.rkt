; Problem 3
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; IMPORTANT:
; 1. The functions that you design for this problem *must* use the ISL list
;    abstraction(s); you MAY NOT use recursion: doing so will lead you to get
;    no code credit for the function :(
;
; 2. The planning part of this problem is in the SAME file used for ALL parts
;    of Homework 8.


; Your task in this problem is to help fishing boat skippers adhere to strict
; rules about fishing in the United States. In particular, catching and keeping
; a fish that is below a certain size can result in a hefty fine. However, these
; rules don't apply to any fish designed as an "invasive species." (In fact, in
; many locations, the act of releasing these fish back into the wild carries its
; own fine!)

; For a fishing boat skipper to know that they are following the above rules for
; fish to release, they must keep track their fish and at every point in time on
; the trip, they need to be able to determine which non-invasive fish in their
; catch are above the minimum size restriction (we'll use 8 inches). For this
; purpose, a catch is represented with the following data definition:


(define-struct fish [species length-in-inches])

; A Fish is a (make-fish String PosNum)
; Interpretation: name of fish and length in inches.

(define FISH-1 (make-fish "Carp" 20))
(define FISH-2 (make-fish "Guppy" 1))
(define FISH-3 (make-fish "Lake Trout" 8))
(define FISH-4 (make-fish "Snakehead" 10))
(define FISH-5 (make-fish "Big Trout" 13))

(define (fish-temp f)
  (... (fish-species f) ...
       (fish-length-in-inches f) ...))

(define INVASIVE (list "Carp" "Guppy" "Snakehead"))

; Your task is to design the function viable-fish, which takes in a list of
; caught fish and a list of names of invasive species (represented as strings)
; and returns a list, in the same order as the input, of the non-invasive fish
; that are larger than 8 inches.


; TODO 1/2: Plan your solution, using the planning interface described on the
;           canvas page for this assignment. ALL PLANNING FOR THIS HW WILL BE
;           DONE IN THE SAME PLACE, AND SUBMITTED TOGETHER.

; TODO 2/2: Design the function viable-fish using the ISL list abstractions.
;           YOUR CODE SHOULD NOT USE ANY RECURSION.

(check-expect (viable-fish (list FISH-1 FISH-2 FISH-3 FISH-4 FISH-5) (list "Lake Trout" "Hi"))
              (list FISH-1 FISH-4 FISH-5))

(check-expect (viable-fish (list FISH-1 FISH-2 FISH-3 FISH-4 FISH-5) (list "Lake Trout" "Big Trout"))
              (list FISH-1 FISH-4))

(check-expect (viable-fish (list FISH-1) (list "Carp"))
              (list))

; viable-fish: [List-of Fish] [List-of String] -> [List-of Fish]
; takes in a list of caught fish and a list of names of invasive species (represented as strings) and
; returns a list, in the same order as the input, of the non-invasive fish that are larger than
; 8 inches.
(define (viable-fish lof los)

  (local [
          ; non-invasive-fish: Fish -> Boolean
          ; creates a boolean local that checks of the fish in the supplied string is not an
          ; invasive species, & it is larger than 8 inches
          (define (non-invasive-fish fish)
            (and
             (not
              (ormap (Î» (base-string) (string=? base-string (fish-species fish))) los))
             (< 8 (fish-length-in-inches fish))))]
    (filter non-invasive-fish lof)))
