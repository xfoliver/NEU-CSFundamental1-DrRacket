;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; This problem asks you to design several functions that employ the
; following data definitions. The functions that you design *must* use
; list abstraction(s) when appropriate; you MAY NOT use recursion: doing
; so will lead you to get no code credit for the function :(
;
; NOTE #1: Part of the credit for each problem will be based on the choice
; of list abstractions, so make sure that they are a good match for the
; problem.
;
; NOTE #2: For certain problems, you will have to design helper functions
; that do not use list abstractions. You should follow the full design
; recipe (including appropriate use of templates) for all problems. Be sure
; to do this, even if it feels a bit tedious - listen to your templates!!
;
